# Hello world! 

> I finally had a personal website. I will post everyday about my work reflection, career development, and life explorations!

> For now I want to try different things, such as mobile/web app dev, and VR/AR dev. 

> Starting from personal website, I intended to write blogs and add pictures. 

> Then I will help my friends to have their personal websites too! They can better advertise for their personal business!

> Later I should also add analytics feature to track my data. Like scoring for mood(depression detection) and biometrics data once I get a wearable device. 

> This site will literally becomes my prescence online.
